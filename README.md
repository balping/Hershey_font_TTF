# Hershey font TTF files

### What is Hershey font?
- About [Hershey Fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts).
  - Hershey fonts are vector fonts made of strokes. Currently there is on official TTF/OTF support for Hershey.
  - However, Hershey fonts have been widely used in the astronomy community (pre-Python).

### Why TTF?
- To be able to keep the style, [AVHershey-OTF](https://github.com/scruss/AVHershey-OTF/tree/master/otf) profiles a OTF "projection" of the original Hershey fonts.
- Here, for personal use, I ddded italic styles and a few missing fonts (ui2299 for example) then created TTF files.
- I will try to update the fonts by adding more missing characters.
